2.1 CSS3 Loading Animations
===========================

2.1.1 - Animate the dots.

1.
Html - dot's in a span class
<span class="dot_one"> .</span>

2.
Css - we locate all three of them and set the opacity to 0
span[class^='dot_'] {
  opacity: 0;
}

3. 
Start animate the first dot with keyframes
@keyframes dot_one {
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  15% {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  25% {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  100% {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}

4.
The animation is ready to go if we set the target - how much time, the loop and the animation timing function.
.dot_one {
  animation: dot_one 2s infinite linear;

5. 
We do the same for the other dots.
We only have to change the percentenge of time.
Use:
@keyframes
and the animation target.

2.1.2 Animate a bouncing ball

1.
Html create the div's.

2.
In the Css:
.bouncing ball - defines the position
.ball - difines the shape

3.
Use keyframes to define the animation with the name bounce.
The ease-in time make the animation slower.
@keyframes bounce { }

4. 
We define the width and height at determine points to make the animation more realistic.

5.
In the .ball class we set the animation.
.ball {
animation: bounce 1s infinite;
}

2.1.3 Animate a spinner

1.
In the HTML and CSS we define the spiner shape. 

2.
Then we create the shape of the curves and positioning it.

3.
Define how do they act with keyframes 

4.
Aplly the keyframe to our curves.

===================================
2.2 Make ordinary links interesting
===================================

1.
In the first case we add a fade in effect to our link.

2.
In the second case we add a slide background effect
in this case we have to add a data-linktext attribute in the HTML.

The data attributes are part of HTML5 allows to define the extra pieces of data that can be attaced to any element.

In this case data-linktext='other parts' the text will be accessed and reused by our css.

3.
In the third case we add a slide line effect.
We don't need the data-linktext anymore.

We going to style the classes
